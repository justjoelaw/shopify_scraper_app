# Shopify App Store Scraper

**Set up jobs to scrape reviews from the Shopify App Store!**
- Run and track scraping jobs from the UI
- Analyse review rating trends over time

I built this project primarily to get some hands-on practice using React, focusing on a real-world problem I had encountered.
The app employs the following technologies:
- Django - as a backend
- Django Rest Framework - REST API
- Selenium & BeautifulSoup - webscraping
- React - frontend
